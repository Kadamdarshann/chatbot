# Chatbot Creation using NLP and Python 🤖✨

This project demonstrates how to create a **Jaguar Chatbot**, a conversational AI system that responds to user queries based on predefined data. The chatbot leverages **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques and Python libraries to process and analyze human language.

## 🛠️ Project Overview

### What is a Chatbot?
A chatbot is a program designed to simulate conversation with users by processing input text and providing relevant responses.

### Key Features:
- **NLP-Based Query Response:** Processes user queries and provides meaningful responses.
- **Data Handling:** Efficiently reads and manipulates query-response datasets.
- **Visualization:** Uses plotting libraries for data representation.

---

## 📚 Libraries Used

1. **nltk** (Natural Language Toolkit):  
   - A platform for building Python programs that process human language data.
   - Used for tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, and other NLP tasks.

2. **string:**  
   - Provides constants like `ascii_lowercase` and `ascii_uppercase` for handling text processing.

3. **pandas:**  
   - Used to create and manipulate dataframes for query-response datasets.
   - Allows easy reading and modification of datasets.

4. **numpy:**  
   - Provides numerical computation support, often used for handling array-like structures.

5. **matplotlib:**  
   - A plotting library used to create visualizations for data analysis.

## 📂 Dataset Overview

### Query-Response Data:
- The dataset contains two main columns:
  1. **Query:** The user input, e.g., "Hi, how are you doing?"
  2. **Response:** The chatbot's reply, e.g., "I'm fine. How about yourself?"

### Loading Data:
- **Method 1:** Directly load the dataset from a file (e.g., `.csv` or `.txt`).
- **Method 2:** Use predefined dialogues stored in variables.

### Example Dataset:
| Query                | Response                        |
|----------------------|---------------------------------|
| Hi, how are you doing? | I'm fine. How about yourself? |
| What's your name?      | I'm Jaguar, your chatbot!     |

## 🚀 Workflow

### 1. **Data Loading:**
- Read the dataset using pandas.
- Assign headers (`Query` and `Response`) for better readability.

### 2. **Data Understanding:**
- Inspect the dataset to gain insights into its structure and content.
- Perform exploratory data analysis to understand query and response patterns.

### 3. **Data Processing:**
- Tokenize and preprocess text data using `nltk`.
- Clean text by removing stopwords, punctuations, and unnecessary whitespace.

### 4. **Building the Chatbot:**
- Use the query-response pairs to train the chatbot.
- Implement logic to match user queries with the most relevant responses.

### 5. **Visualization:**
- Use `matplotlib` to create plots for data insights.
